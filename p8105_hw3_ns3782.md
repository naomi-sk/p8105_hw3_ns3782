## Dataset Overview

The NY NOAA dataset contains 2595176 observations of 7 weather related
variables, corresponding to daily weather data collected from 747 unique
weather stations in New York City. The date range of the observations is
from 1981-01-01 to 2010-12-31.

Key variables and their types include: `id` (character, weather station
identifier), `date` (Date, YYYY-MM-DD), `prcp` (integer, precipitation),
`snow` (integer, snowfall), `snwd` (integer, snow depth), `tmax`
(character, maximum temperature), `tmin` (character, minimum
temperature).

Missing data is an issue in this dataset. The total number of missing
values across all variables is 3387623, which represents 18.65% of all
observations in the dataset.

For the id variable, there are 0 missing values (0% of total
observations). The date variable has 0 missing values (0% of total
observations). Precipitation (prcp) has 145838 missing values (5.62% of
total observations). For snowfall (snow), there are 381221 missing
values (14.69% of total observations). Snow depth (snwd) has 591786
missing values (22.8% of total observations). Maximum temperature (tmax)
has 1134358 missing values (43.71% of total observations). Minimum
temperature (tmin) has 1134420 missing values (43.71% of total
observations).

## Notes regarding data cleaning

In the process of cleaning the NOAA weather data, I undertook several
unit conversions to improve interpretability of the weather data.
Precipitation was changed from tenths of mm to mm, while snowfall and
snow depth were converted from mm to cm. These are in line with typical
measures used for these data. Maximum and minimum temperatures were also
adjusted from tenths of degrees Celsius to whole degrees Celsius. These
conversions were made to standardise units across the weather variables
and enable easier subsequent analysis.

## Most Common Snowfall values

The most common snowfall values for NYC are 0 cm (2008508 occurrences),
followed by NA (381221 occurrences). 0 is the most common, likely due to
New York City rarely having snow year round particularly in recent
years, while NA represents missing data. The next most common values are
2.5, 1.3, 5.1 cm, which are 1 inch, 0.5 inch, and 2 inches respectively.
These are indicative of typical light to moderate snowfall events, which
would be expected of New York City during colder months.

## Average max temperature in January and in July

There are several observations based on the two-panel plot showing the
average max temperature in January and in July in each station across
years. First, expected seasonal differences in maximum temperature are
observable between the winter and summer months in New York. July
temperatures are consistently higher on average (20-35°C) than January
temperatures (-10 to 10°C). Second, January temperatures appear to have
more variability than July temperatures, which may be typical for NYC’s
climate. Third, there is a spike in maximum temperatures for July 2010.
Several stations show temperatures reaching or exceeding 30°C. This
appears to be the highest point on the entire July graph, suggesting
that July 2010 may have been the hottest July in the 30-year period
shown. Lastly, concerning outliers. The month of January shows
comparatively more extreme outliers compared to July, with some years in
January observed to have unusually low or high temperatures. This is
especially apparent around 1982, where there is a dip in temperature
below -10°C. July has fewer extreme outliers, but there is a notable dip
around 1988 for one weather station to below 15°C suggesting a
significant weather event, or weather station recording error.

## Data Cleaning Process

As part of the initial data wrangling process for Problem 2, I imported
two datasets containing relevant NHANES study information, including
demographic information (nhanes_covar) and accelerometer datasets
(nhanes_accel). I proceeded to clean variable names in both using the
janitor function. Subsequently, I merged these datasets using a left
join on the ‘seqn’ variable, as this represents the sequence number or
unique identifier for each observation (participant) in NHANES. The
resulting dataset was filtered to include only participants aged 21 and
older as specified, and rows with missing demographic data were removed.
Finally, I recoded the ‘sex’ and ‘education’ variables as factors with
appropriate labels, with ‘education’ set as an ordered factor. This
process resulted in a clean, merged dataset ready for analysis, with
properly formatted categorical variables for sex and education level.

# Load and install necessary package

  group_by(education, sex) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%

  mutate(Total = male + female) %>%
  rename(Male = male, Female = female) %>%
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., education = "Total", 
              Male = sum(Male, na.rm = TRUE), 
              Female = sum(Female, na.rm = TRUE), 
              Total = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE))
  )

NHANES Accelerometer Study: Participant Count by Sex and Education Level

## NHANES Accelerometer Study: Participant Count by Sex and Education Level

The table shows the distribution participants in the NHANES
Accelerometer Study across sex and education levels. A total of 228
participants are observed. There is relatively balanced representation
of males (118) and females (110) in this sample. In each education
group, there is an approximately equal number of males and females, with
exception of the high school equivalent group where there are more males
than females. There appears to be a greater number of participants with
higher education in this sample, as noted by the number of participants
with advanced education compared to those with less than high school or
equivalent, which may reflect broader educational trends or potential
selection bias in the study. Approximately half of the participants
(115) have more than a high school education, indicating a skew towards
higher education levels in the sample.

## NHANES Accelerometer Study: Age Distribution by Sex and Education Level

The ridge plot shows varying age distributions across education levels
and sexes in the NHANES Accelerometer Study. For those with less than
high school education, the age distribution skews older for both sexes,
with a peak around 60-70 years. The high school equivalent category
shows a more uniform age spread, particularly for males. A noteworthy
observation is that the “More than high school” group skews
comparatively younger in age compared to the other education groups,
especially for females, with a pronounced peak around 30-40 years. This
suggests generational differences in educational attainment, with a
greater number of younger participants, especially young females, having
higher education levels in the current sample. The plot also reveals sex
differences, particularly in higher education, where females show a
stronger representation in younger age groups compared to males. These
observations align with the participant counts in the accompanying
table, which shows a higher number of participants (115) in the “More
than high school” category.

# Calculate total activity and add it to nhanes_cleaned

  rowwise() %>%

  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ education, ncol = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("male" = "purple", "female" = "skyblue")) +
  labs(title = "Total Daily Activity vs Age by Sex and Education Level",
       x = "Age (years)",
       y = "Total Daily Activity (MIMS)",
       color = "Sex") 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ns3782_files/figure-gfm/problem_2_total_activity-1.png" width="100%" />

## Total Daily Activity vs Age, by Sex and Education Level

Based on the plot, there is a general observable trend of decreasing
activity with age across the different education categories, though this
rate of and extent of decline varies depending on sex and education
level. In the “Less than high school” group, men appear to have slightly
higher activity levels than women in middle age, which declines to be
close to equivalent in old age (70-80 years). The “High school
equivalent” category shows that females tend to have higher activity
levels in in their 20s, declining to have similar activity levels to
males around age 60. The “More than high school” group shows a similar
distribution of activity levels between the sexes. However, around age
50 females have a slight spike in activity levels compared to men. This
difference then declines, and by age 80, the activity levels between
sexes in this education group become similar.
